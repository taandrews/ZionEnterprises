## Notes

- This is a **demo build** — all backend interactions are mocked
- Priority is visual polish and UX flow to impress the client
- Mobile-first responsive design is critical — target audience browses on phones
- All compliance copy must be pixel-perfect and present on correct pages
- Admin dashboard should look functional even if data is static
